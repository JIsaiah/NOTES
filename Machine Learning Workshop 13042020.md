Machine Learning is the ability of the computer to learn independently without given explicit programming. AI uses parameters while ML does not. AI learns through human input and ML. Machine Learning can be divided into three sub-groups, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

An algorithm is the way the computer learns, just like the way humans learn from brain input.

_Supervised Learning:_
This uses input data to work out a 'target variable'. It uses all previous data to predict an answer by comparing the data. The more information given, the easier it is to predict a more accurate answer. The accuracy improves with more data.

Supervised Learning is broken down into two types:
Regression: This is when the target variable is numeric. (e.g. 1, 2, 5.4, 9,007)

Classification: This is when the target variable is a category/classification. The parameters must first be set by someone. (e.g. true/false, retweets/likes/reports, inbox/spam/social)

_Unsupervised Learning:_
This uses input data to find hidden patterns or groupings in data. It looks at the data to make clusters of data and find which clusters are relevent to its cause.

_Reinforcement Learning:_
A learning method that trains algorithms using a reward and punishment system, where the algorithm interacts with its environment to find out what gets it rewarded and what gets it punished.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
The unknown value becomes the value of its neighbor (The closest values near it).
The drawback is that there might be outliers that change the shape of the decision function line.

There are three types of distance movements: (VSCode no pics so go google)
_Euclidean Distance_
_Manhattan Distance_
_Chebyshev Distance_
